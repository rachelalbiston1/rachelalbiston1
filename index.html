    <h2>FIRST SPRINT </h2>
    <p>The aim of my first sprint is to create <span class="emphasise"> a defined drawing area on the canvas. </span> <br>
    When mousedown and mousemove are true, the rectangle should change size and shape dependant on the MouseStart and current mouse coordinations.   <br>
    As the mouse is released the rectangle should form on the canvas. I also plan to create a boundary box which I will then put listeners and restrictions in during the next sprint.

        <h2>SECOND SPRINT</h2>
        <p>My aim for this sprint is to create <span class="emphasise">restrictions to only be able to draw inside the boundary box.</span> <br> 
        When mousedown and mousemove are true, the rectangle should change size and shape dependant on the mousestart and current mouse coordinations.   <br>
        As the mouse is released the rectangle should appear inside the boundary box. If the mouse is dragged outside the boundary box the rectangle should not form. <br> </p>

    <h3> TESTING </h3>
    <p> The <span class="emphasise"> first test </span> explores the movement of the mouse inside the boundary box. <br>
        I tested moving the mouse through and around my boundary box by using true and false, if the mouse was inside the boundary box there would be a console log of true and if it wasn't inside the box there would be a console log of false.

    <p> The <span class="emphasise"> second and final test, </span> this test will comeplete my overall first and second sprint.<br>
        The completed sprint should show the movement of the mouse with the guided rectangle inside the boundary box and not outside this box. If user releases the mouse a rectangle should appear inside the boundary box.<br> 
        If user tries to draw outside the boundary box there should be no movement.

    <h2>FOURTH SPRINT </h2>
    <p>My aim for this sprint is to create <span class="emphasise">colour swatches so I can draw my shapes with different colours.</span> <br> 
    This allows the user to draw with either an ellipse or a rectangle inside the boundary box with a range of six potential colours. </p>
    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint four/fourth.png"></div>

    <h3> TESTING </h3>
    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> first test </span> explores the creation of the colour swatch array. <br>
        Via my new file button.js I am able to create a function and push the buttons through if the mouse is in the boundary and mouse is down. I used swatch.selectedcolour to fill the drawing shape to the colour inputted when the mouse is inside the boundary.
    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint four/colourswatcharray.png"></div>

    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> second test </span> explores how the user knows what colour is selected. Using the drawStrokeRect function I am able to highlight the stroke colour when button is selected. This makes it more practical for the user to draw as they know what colour they've selected.  <br>      
        <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint four/selectedcolarray.png"></div>

     <p> The <span class="emphasise"> third and final test, </span> this test will comeplete my fourth sprint.<br>
        The completed sprint should show my new colour swatch array, with six colours, which when a shape is selected will draw in the colour selected, shown to the user by the stroke border colour. <br>

    <h3> TESTING </h3>
    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> first test </span> explores the creation of button for the diamond function. <br>
        Through the button.js file I am able to create a diamond button which can be used when selected to draw the diamond.
    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint five/diamondbutton.png"></div>

    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> second test </span> explores the drawing of the diamond when mouse is up and inside the boundary box, this tests whether the button 'Diamond' is pushing the object through object set.<br>      
        I also had an issue where some of the diamond was being drawn outside the boundary box, this required me to create the clip() function to clip the object and prevent it from shown outside the boundary box.

    <h2>SIXTH SPRINT </h2>
    <p>My aim for this sprint is to create <span class="emphasise"> undo and reset buttons, along with a new colour scheme and layout </span> for my program.<br> 
    This allows th program to be more practical for the user and overall look more appealling to the eye. </p>

    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint six/sixthtrello.png"></div>

    <h3> TESTING </h3>
    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> first test </span> explores the creation of the undo and reset buttons. <br>
        To reset I am using the class objectSet and clearing it which will reset the screen back to how it started, and to undo I am using the class objectSet.pop() to remove the last shape added into objectSet.

    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> second test </span> was changing the theme colour and creating a white background to put under the colour array. <br>      
       This was enabled to make the program look more professional and easiest to read and understand. I did this creating a Background class, similar to my drawingPage class however without the boundary aspects. This meant I created x,y,w,h values to know the size of the white background rectangle. <br> 
       I also changed my swatch colours via my init.js file and added more shades to introduce more versatility into the program making it more useable.

    <div><img class="imgSizer" src="sprint seven/trello.png"></div>

    <h3> TESTING </h3>
    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> first test </span> was designing a circle, this created another shape for the user to play with which makes program more interesting and active. <br>
        I did this by creating a circle class and using math.abs to make the values always positive, and this.r to set the radius of the circle.

    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> second test </span> was designing the line to again add more variety to the user. I decided just to test one size for now but later on I might investigate creating more as this will be more beneficial to the user and the program.<br>    
        I did this by creating a line class and using xMouseStart and yMousStart to know the location where the mouse started and then using xMouse and yMouse to see where the mouse ended up. We can then take all these numbers and draw a line between them which will create my line shape.

This button has the ability to change the colour of any last created object, for example if nothing on the camvas it will change the canvas colour itself. However, if their are shapes on the canvas it will change the colour of the most recent one drawn. <br> 
        This object make it easy for the user to fix mistakes or if they've changed their mind about something, or to have different canvas colours.<br>

    <p>  The <span class="emphasise"> second test </span> was creating my rotating rectangle button, including five different speeds to give other complex shapes to the program. <br> 
        By using the mini_Button class and variables such as this.degrees, this.degreecount, and mini_Button.selectedD I am able to program so that each rotation rectangle drawn has a different speed depending on what mini_Button is selected.

     <p> The <span class="emphasise"> third and final test, </span> this test will comeplete my tenth and final sprint.<br>
        The completed sprint should show my new rotating rectangle with five different speeds, and my new colour edit button, as well as everything else from my past sprints. <br>
        My completed program should be drawing, active with no errors or bugs which would prevent the program from running.

    <h3> REFLECTION </h3>
    <p> After finishing my final sprint and overall program there is nothing else to edit. Overall reflection, I am extremely happy with the drawing program I have produced and I believe will be handy and loved by it's user. If I was to complete a project like this again, or further improve this one I would like to elaborate on creating more shapes and active objects. <br>
        I would be interested in the user being able to add text to their drawing, and also added shapes which only have a stroke colour not a fill colour. <br>
        Another improvement would be to have a larger canvas giving more room for the user to create their masterpiece. </p>

     <h2> IMPLICATIONS </h2>
     <p> <span class="emphasise"> Future Proofing - </span> the drawing program is designed so new features can be easily added and old ones removed from the code. <br>
         <span class="emphasise"> Addressed - </span> the drawing program has been addressed via program elements such as colours, buttons, and shapes, these have all been programmed as objects, meaning that each object is a self-contained modular piece of code. These take a defined set of parametres to run and draw, which consists of basic mouse data and colour information. <br>
         <span class="emphasise"> Structure - </span> all objects are built in a similar structure and compulsorily contain an update function which means they can appear on the interface using the update call. <br>
         <span class="emphasise"> Management - </span> the management around most objects occurs in a central location (drawingPage.js). The overall idea is that an experienced programmer could easily add new features or remove elements, by the creator heavily commenting the code (imformatively and pricisely) to help show where and what the functions are called. </p>
     
    <h3> FUNCTIONALITY </h3>
    <p>  <span class="emphasise"> Functionality questions whether the program works well - </span> free of bugs, is responsive, loads, is fast, and works on different browsers. <br>
        This has been addressed by being programmed in pur javascript, there is no graphics which means it is able to load quickly for the user. <br> 
        The program has also been throughly tested using a live web server to store my past and present versions, by this I have observed and judged the loading performance. <br>
        To ensure the program works well and is acceptable to give to other users I have systematically tested it - user interactions (position of clicking and direction of dragging), careful checks around the boundaries, the use of the Math.abs function was discovered after testing failures drawing circular shapes (these objects were being given negative radius values). <br>
        New components were tested before being added to the main program. Through the different sprints, console.log was used to analyse boundary test functions and to locate problems when errors or bugs appear. <br> </p>
            
    <h3> EXAMPLE OF TRIALLING AND MAKING DECISIONS </h3>
    <p> Trailing different options for allowing the user to draw circles on screen - giving circular or rectangular guides. <br>
        Effectively using the information from testing and trialling to improve the functionality of the outcome, such as design and colour themes. <br>
        Finding situations where objects were drawn outside of the drawing area (in spite of having in-boundary parameters) led to the use of the boundsCheck function. This will be tested by console.log("insideBoundary") and moving the mouse in and out of the boundary to see whether it's returning true or false. This overall lead me to use the clip() function to ensure no drawing was shown outside the boundary box. <br>
        My working process (planning, testing, and trailing) led me to the development of a high quality digital program. This agile process was helpful when creating my program as it allowed me to plan out everything that needed to happen in each different sprint which kept me on track in terms of completing my drawing program. It also allowed the development and planning to happen together <br> 
        I created repeated cycles of plan → develop → test through my creation period. After the third spint I was able to gather a clearer idea of what I could achieve in each sprint and my aims become more focussed and realistic in terms of what I could create for the drawing program. <br> 
        It also helped to see the project in a highly simplified form at the start (potentially shippable product). Project backlog is a list of everything that needs to occur in the program, in terms of my creation period being a shorter one it was important to prioritize the more important aspects that needed to be included into the program, such as simple shapes like rectangles, cirles, and squares etc, but also a tool like the brush and colour editing. </p>
